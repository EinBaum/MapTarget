# MapTarget

AddOn for hunters. Changes what mouse clicks on your minimap do:

- Normal click: Targets whatever you are clicking
- Alt/Ctrl-click: Creates a ping
- Shift-click: Creates a ping but the X and Y coords of the ping are multiplied by 5

## Why?

- Tracking: This AddOn makes all "red dots" on the minimap clickable. It's a great way of targeting players who are hiding behind objects or inside buildings
- Eagle Eye: Did you know that you can cast Eagle Eye and target a place on the minimap? Using the shift-click feature you can cast Eagle Eye on very very far away places

## Notes

- Does not change MiniMap layout. Use this AddOn with any other MiniMap AddOn.
